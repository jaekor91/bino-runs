/---- Organization
./data/ 	All original data files are stored in here.
	./data/derived/		Any derived data files are stored in here.
./figure/		All figures generated are stored in here.
./input-catalogs/ 		These are *.txt input catalogs to BinoMask.
./output-catalogs/		These are *.json output files from BinoMask.




/---- Binospec dimensions:
- Mask dimension (including gap): 17.33' x 15'
- One-arm mask dimension: 8' x 15' 
- Area covered by a mask (including gap): 0.0722 sq. deg.
	- 5K/deg^2 --> 361 targets
- Area covered by a mask (exluding the gap): 0.0667 sq. deg. 
	- 5K/deg^2 --> 333 targets




/---- Fields/Masks/Data
Specs
- Grating: 600 lines/mm, 8750A and 6450A
- 2 x 15 mins per grating configuration (one hour with overhead)
- Slit width/length: 1" x 6"

COSMOS
- Number of masks: 2
- Legacy Survey/DR: 3
- Constraints: Based on the region that overlaps with Christophe's geometry.
- Data:
	- List_RF_Cosmos.fits (From Christophe)
	- ./data/DR3/COSMOS/ Tractor files for the same region.
		- Scripts used: 
			- generate-tractor-download-script-COSMOS.py
			- tractor-download-COSMOS.sh
- Notes: Because the Fields is void of bright stars and is small, rather than creating a small catalog for each mask, I generate targets for the whole field and simply select two non-overlapping fields on BinoMask.

/---- Generate input catalogs
General plan: For each Field
- Combine all the Tractor files in the region. 
- Apply allmasks, invar > 0, and Tycho-2 mask.
- Create a bit vector.
- Apply NDM selections. (Make color term corrections for DR4/6. Apply to the intrinsic model before addition of noise. For DR4/6, the union of all Tractor files available on local directory can be used as the calibration file. Note that this is perhaps done best by first creating union catalogs in each field and computing the area therein.)
- Cross-match RF targets onto the combined and trimmed catalog.
- Apply FDR cut.
- Import SDSS stars and galaxies. Make astrometric correction by cross-matching.

Combine Tractor files, apply masks, and create a bit vector and calculate area.
- Notes: For convenience, I combine Tractor files in each Field. Note I compute area using MC methods. Only the following fields are saved. 
	- RA, DEC
	- gflux, rflux, zflux (de-reddened)
The following cuts are imposed. 
	- allmasks
	- Tycho-2
	- invar > 0
	- g < 24
	- brick_primary
I create RA/DEC plots of individual field
- Scripts used:
	- COSMOS-combine-tractor.py
	- DR6-combine-tractor.py
	- HSC-combine-tractor.py
- Products: All data products contain area as Field A. Destination directory ./data/
	- COSMOS-union-tractor.npz/RADEC-COSMOS-union.png

COSMOS depths checking
- Notes: COSMOS field may be deeper so we verify the COSMOS depths. 
- Script used: 
	- COSMOS-DR3-union-tractor-depth-check.py
- Product:
	- COSMOS-DR3-union-tractor-depths.png


Check astrometry of COSMOS region
- Notes: We check the astrometry of COSMOS DR3 using DR5. We first combine the DR5 Tractor files in COSMOS. Next, we check the astrometry. There ended up being a minor difference. But still.
- Scripts used:
	- COSMOS-combine-tractor-DR5.py
	- COSMOS-DR3-DR5-astrometry-check.py
- Product:
	- COSMOS-DR5-union-tractor.npz/RADEC-COSMOS-DR5-union.png
	- COSMOS-DR5-DR3-subtractive-correction.npz: Med diff to be subtracted from DR3.
	- COSMOS-DR3-DR5-astrometry-diff.png

Stars and galaxies files.
- Notes: For each field, given union Tractor files, take the standard star/galaxy files and perform astrometric correction. Save ra, dec, gmag of galaxies.
- Scripts used:
	- COSMOS-sdss-stars-gals-script.py
	- DR6-sdss-stars-gals-script.py

NDM selection modules
- Notes: NDM selection was produced using NDM module under NDM-paper/. The outputs moved into the current directory for documentation.
(1/23/2018: Though later there was discovered an error in marginal efficiency computation, since that doesn't affect the actual calculation, we do not correct the saved result.)

	- NDM_utils.py (For archival purpose only. Did not use to produce results.)
	- NDM_models.py (For archival purpose only. Did not use to produce results.)

Create input catalogs
- Notes: Create input catalogs for each field. RA/DEC plots of targets (NDM, FDR, RF, all)
	- Load the Tractor catalog. 
	- Generate bit vector of the same length.
	- Record RF.
	- Record FDR.
	- Apply NDM and record NDM.
	- Load stars/gals
	- Generate the input catalogs.
- Scripts used:
	- NDM_utils.py, NDM_models.py: Only used for selecting objects given already produced selection region. (See above.)

- Create input catalogs with the following: 
	- Name, ra, dec, gmag, priority, type
	- Priority 1: SDSS stars
	- Priority 2: SDSS galaxies
	- Priority 3: All targets (name = bit number)	
- Bit numbers have the following meaning.
	- 1: SDSS stars
	- 2: SDSS galaxies	
    - 3: FDR cut as reported in FDR.

	- 6: NDM fiducial but U_Gold = 2. Ndesired = 3000
	- 7: NDM fiducial but U_NoZ = 0.5 Ndesired = 3000
	- 8: RF1, RF tuned for 2400 deg
	- 9: RF2, RF tuned for 3000 deg

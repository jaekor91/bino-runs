This is a check list for creating DESI masks for 2018A February observation.

/---- Contents
- Organization: A guide to how the directory is organized.
- Binospec dimensions: Describe dimensions of the binospeck mask
- Fields/Masks/Data: Describe Fields and the description of masks to be used.
- Other data: Describe other data used and stored in ./data/
- Data pre-processing: Generate astrometry corrected catalogs and store in ./data/derived/
- Strategy: Describe generally the strategy used to create masks.
- Results: Describe the results of masks designed using the above strategy.





/---- Organization
./data/ 	All original data files are stored in here.
	./data/derived/		Any derived data files are stored in here.
./figure/		All figures generated are stored in here.
./input-catalogs/ 		These are *.txt input catalogs to BinoMask.
./output-catalogs/		These are *.json output files from BinoMask.




/---- Binospec dimensions:
- Mask dimension (including gap): 17.33' x 15'
- One-arm mask dimension: 8' x 15' 
- Area covered by a mask (including gap): 0.0722 sq. deg.
	- 5K/deg^2 --> 361 targets
- Area covered by a mask (exluding the gap): 0.0667 sq. deg. 
	- 5K/deg^2 --> 333 targets




/---- Fields/Masks/Data
COSMOS
- Number of masks: 2
- Legacy Survey/DR: 3
- Data:
	- From Christpohe
		- List_RF_Cosmos.fits


HSC 
- Number of masks:
	- Six in 16h+44
	- Six near 7-8h +33 range
- Legacy Survey/DR: 6
- Data:
	- From Christophe:
		- List_RF_HSC_dr6.fits				
		- List_RF_Stripe_ra_32_40_dec_100_270_dr6.fits

- Note from Daniel: I suggest we design 6 masks in the HSC region (16h+44) and 6 masks in the 7-8h +33 range. The former is constrained to the map that Christophe sent.  For the latter, I don't know the geometry; you'll have to grab the data and see. Basically we want to fill the LST gap between 2h30+0 and 10h+0, which means we want to go as early as we can in the NGC.  I'm trying to give priority to the BASS/DECaLS overlap region, but if that's really not possible, then we could go further north.

/---- Data pre-processing
Correct astrometric differences, extract necessary columns, and save the objects in a convenient form to use.
- Script used: data-preprocess.py
- Outputs:
	- ./data/derived/targets-rset4.npz
	- ./data/derived/targets-rset56.npz
	- ./data/derived/sdss.npz	
	- Columns extracted: Astometric corrections have already been applied
		- SDSS: RA, DEC, g, r, objid
		- Targets (rset==4): RA, DEC, ID
		- Targets (rset==5 or 6): RA, DEC, ID	
- Figures:

- Notes:
	- Astrometric difference observations:
		- CANDELS had a good match rate in GOODS-N (3,014/3,917). 0.3" difference in DEC!
		- GOODS-N had a really low match rate in GAIA (54/39,432) but there does not appear to be a significant astrometric difference.
		- Apply combined astrometric correction to CANDELS targets to bring them to GAIA system. 
		- SDSS had a good match rate in GAIA (265/345). Sub 0.1" difference in RA/DEC. Direct substitutions for matched objects and median corrections for the rest.

/---- Data
Lyman alpha targets catalog: Bouwens (2015).
- File name: ./data/apj508910t3_mrt.txt
- Source: http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/803/1/34/suppdata/apj508910t3_mrt.txt
- Notes: "dset == 6" and "rset == 4, 5, 6" are what we want. Put "rset==4" on one set of masks and the other on another.

GOODS-N catalog
- File name: ./data/h_goods_ni_r2.0z_cat.txt
- Source: https://archive.stsci.edu/pub/hlsp/goods/catalog_r2/
- Notes: Not the parent catalog of the above but used to correct the astrometry of targets to the GAIA system.

SDSS Standard stars:
- File name: ./data/standards.goodsn_gr04.txt
- Source: Daniel Eisenstein
- Notes from Daniel: "Attached are blue stars from SDSS in a 4 deg^2 region around GOODS-N. 0.2<g-r<0.4  187<RA<191  61<dec<63, 17<r<20. There will only be 5-6 in a given Binospec mask! You'll need to check this astrometry relative to Gaia.  For best accuracy, substitute the Gaia position, if for no other reason that any proper motion from ~2003 to 2016 will be removed."

Gaia data: Used to correct the astrometry of main targets and standard stars.
- File name: ./data/gaia.fits
- Source: Doug Finkbeiner, private repository.
- Script:
	- retrive-gaia.py: Used to retrieve the file. Contains Terminal commands used.
- Notes from Daniel: "I suggest that you pull all the Gaia stars within 15' of this field. You'll need to go down to G=20.5 to find enough HST comparison points. Then the brighter Gaia stars can be guide stars."
- Note: We don't need to find our own guide stars. BinoMask provides appropriate guide stars. I retrieved stars only down to 20 mag.





/---- Data pre-processing
Correct astrometric differences, extract necessary columns, and save the objects in a convenient form to use.
- Script used: data-preprocess.py
- Outputs:
	- ./data/derived/targets-rset4.npz
	- ./data/derived/targets-rset56.npz
	- ./data/derived/sdss.npz	
	- Columns extracted: Astometric corrections have already been applied
		- SDSS: RA, DEC, g, r, objid
		- Targets (rset==4): RA, DEC, ID
		- Targets (rset==5 or 6): RA, DEC, ID	
- Figures:

	2018A-radec-targets56-sdss.png		RADEC-diff-SDSS-vs-GAIA.png
- Notes:
	- Astrometric difference observations:
		- CANDELS had a good match rate in GOODS-N (3,014/3,917). 0.3" difference in DEC!
		- GOODS-N had a really low match rate in GAIA (54/39,432) but there does not appear to be a significant astrometric difference.
		- Apply combined astrometric correction to CANDELS targets to bring them to GAIA system. 
		- SDSS had a good match rate in GAIA (265/345). Sub 0.1" difference in RA/DEC. Direct substitutions for matched objects and median corrections for the rest.





/---- Goals/specs
- Sky slits:
	- We want approximately 150 skies. (Fewer may work just fine.)
	- We want sky slits on the edges to give a more uniform coverage of wavelength.
	- - In order to ensure the possibility that there are sky slits at the edge of the field bounadries, we create two priority classes of the sky.
- Special considerations:
	- Jitter the mask by 10'' up and down and + 5'' left and right to avoid rows or columns of bad pixels.
	- Gutter between the two arms should be at the center. Use (at least) two positions that do not overlap entirely.
- Target priority:
	- Priority 1: Standard stars
	- Priority 2: Sparse set of skies
	- Priority 3: Objects from target catalogs that so far did not receive slits.
	- Priority 4: Objects from target catalogs that received slits in a previous mask.
	- Priority 5: Dense set of skies (Vary the density to achieve the desired density.)
	- Note
- Exp Time/slit dimension:
	- z~5,6: 6 x 2hr. 1.5" x 1.0" wide 
	- z ~ 4: 12 x 2hr. 1.5" x 1.2" wide
	- 8 x 15 mins per exposure
- Gratings/Wavelength range:
	- 600 line/mm grating covers 2400A range or Delta z = 2
	- z~4  : 6,000 A centered for objects in the middle. Desired wavelenght coverage 3<z<5
	- z~5,6: 7,700 A centered for objects in the middle. Desired wavelength coverage 4<z<6.5





/---- Strategy
- Initially, the target files (targets-rset4.npz, targets-rset56.npz) are copied and used to create the first input catalogs following the scheme above. The copies are named *-input.npz
- The intial mask is used to find the two feasible configurations as mentioned above. The two feasible configurations are recorded.
- Next, the target files will be updated so as to indicate which objects received a slit during the initial run. This will be indicated by a bitmask whose first bit corresponds to whether an object received a slit in the first mask, etc.
	- Note that we only have a single set of target files who bit information gets updated progressively.
	- All mask files that contain slit assignment information are stored
- We repeat the above steps until the desired number of masks are obtained. The two configurations are used alternatively.
- We report the following statistics:
	- Histogram of objects with bins corresponding to the number of times an object received a slit.
	- Scatter plot of # of targets vs. # of skies distribution
	- For each mask
		- Expected wavelength range A/B
		- # of guide stars A/B
		- # of standard stars A/B
		- # of skies A/B
		- # of targets A/B
		- Exact RA/DEC and PA
- For each run, a script is used to precisely control which mask files are referenced before constructing the input catalog.

This is a check list for creating slit-dot masks for 2018A February observation of GOODS-North Lyman-alpha targets.

/---- Contents
- Binospec dimensions: Describe dimensions of the binospeck mask
- Data: Describe all the data used and stored in ./data/
- Astrometry: Generate astrometry corrected catalogs and store in ./data/derived/
- Strategy: Describe generally the strategy used to create masks.
- Bit number: Describes the bit number of objects.
- Results: Describe the results of masks designed using the above strategy.





/---- Binospec dimensions:
- Mask dimension (including gap): 17.33' x 15'
- One-arm mask dimension: 8' x 15' 
- Area covered by a mask (including gap): 0.0722 sq. deg.
	- 5K/deg^2 --> 361 targets
- Area covered by a mask (exluding the gap): 0.0667 sq. deg. 
	- 5K/deg^2 --> 333 targets

- Notes from Daniel: "Attached are blue stars from SDSS in a 4 deg^2 region around GOODS-N. 0.2<g-r<0.4  187<RA<191  61<dec<63, 17<r<20. There will only be 5-6 in a given Binospec mask! You'll need to check this astrometry relative to Gaia.  For best accuracy, substitute the Gaia position, if for no other reason that any proper motion from ~2003 to 2016 will be removed."

Gaia data: Used to correct the astrometry of main targets and standard stars.

- Script:
	- retrive-gaia.py: Used to retrieve the file. Contains Terminal commands used.
- Approx. RA/DEC:
- Density per sq. deg.:
- Notes from Daniel: "I suggest that you pull all the Gaia stars within 15' of this field. You'll need to go down to G=20.5 to find enough HST comparison points. Then the brighter Gaia stars can be guide stars."
- Note: We don't need to find our own guide stars. BinoMask provides appropriate guide stars.

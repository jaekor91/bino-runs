This is a check list for creating slit-dot masks for 2018A February observation of GOODS-North Lyman-alpha targets.

/---- Contents
- Binospec dimensions: Describe dimensions of the binospeck mask
- Data: Describe all the data used and stored in ./data/
- Data pre-processing: Generate astrometry corrected catalogs and store in ./data/derived/
- Goals: Describe specs for the two sets of targets.
- Strategy: Describe generally the strategy used to create masks.
- Bit number: Describes the bit number of objects.
- Results: Describe the results of masks designed using the above strategy.





/---- Binospec dimensions:
- Mask dimension (including gap): 17.33' x 15'
- One-arm mask dimension: 8' x 15' 
- Area covered by a mask (including gap): 0.0722 sq. deg.
	- 5K/deg^2 --> 361 targets
- Area covered by a mask (exluding the gap): 0.0667 sq. deg. 
	- 5K/deg^2 --> 333 targets





/---- Data
Lyman alpha targets catalog: Bouwens (2015).
- File name: ./data/apj508910t3_mrt.txt
- Source: http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/803/1/34/suppdata/apj508910t3_mrt.txt
- Notes: "dset == 6" and "rset == 4, 5, 6" are what we want. Put "rset==4" on one set of masks and the other on another.

GOODS-N catalog
- File name: ./data/h_goods_ni_r2.0z_cat.txt
- Source: https://archive.stsci.edu/pub/hlsp/goods/catalog_r2/
- Notes: Not the parent catalog of the above but used to correct the astrometry of targets to the GAIA system.

SDSS Standard stars:
- File name: ./data/standards.goodsn_gr04.txt
- Source: Daniel Eisenstein
- Notes from Daniel: "Attached are blue stars from SDSS in a 4 deg^2 region around GOODS-N. 0.2<g-r<0.4  187<RA<191  61<dec<63, 17<r<20. There will only be 5-6 in a given Binospec mask! You'll need to check this astrometry relative to Gaia.  For best accuracy, substitute the Gaia position, if for no other reason that any proper motion from ~2003 to 2016 will be removed."

Gaia data: Used to correct the astrometry of main targets and standard stars.
- File name: ./data/gaia.fits
- Source: Doug Finkbeiner, private repository.
- Script:
	- retrive-gaia.py: Used to retrieve the file. Contains Terminal commands used.
- Notes from Daniel: "I suggest that you pull all the Gaia stars within 15' of this field. You'll need to go down to G=20.5 to find enough HST comparison points. Then the brighter Gaia stars can be guide stars."
- Note: We don't need to find our own guide stars. BinoMask provides appropriate guide stars. I retrieved stars only down to 20 mag.





/---- Data pre-processing
Correct astrometric differences, extract necessary columns, and save the objects in a convenient form to use.
- Script used: data-preprocess.py
- Outputs:
	- ./data/derived/targets-rset4.npz
	- ./data/derived/targets-rset56.npz
	- ./data/derived/sdss.npz	
	- Columns extracted: Astometric corrections have already been applied
		- SDSS: RA, DEC, g, r, objid
		- Targets (rset==4): RA, DEC, ID
		- Targets (rset==5 or 6): RA, DEC, ID

- Notes:
	- Astrometric difference observations:
		- CANDELS had a good match rate in GOODS-N (3,014/3,917). 0.3" difference in DEC!
		- GOODS-N had a really low match rate in GAIA (54/39,432) but there does not appear to be a significant astrometric difference.
		- Apply combined astrometric correction to CANDELS targets to bring them to GAIA system. 
		- SDSS had a good match rate in GAIA (265/345). Sub 0.1" difference in RA/DEC. Direct substitutions for matched objects and median corrections for the rest.
